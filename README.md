# First-Commit
This is my very first web development project where I created a simple HTML page to promote a 55th birthday celebration. This project marks the beginning of my Full Stack Web Development journey, and I built it as part of the course from Angela Yu on Udemy. I'm excited to learn and grow in this field.
