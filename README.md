# First-Commit
I'm a beginner web developer currently learning Full Stack Web Development through the Udemy course by Angela Yu. This is the first of many projects I plan to complete as I continue my journey in web development. I'm excited to learn and grow in this field and eventually build more complex web applications.

Feel free to check out my GitHub repositories for more of my work as I learn and develop my skills!
